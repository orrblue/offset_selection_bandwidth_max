Priority: 

1.
MATLAB Function that:
Take in config file and number of paths to optimize on —> return map of optimized offsets
More features:
	+ user wants to optimize on all paths by default


2.
MATLAB Function that:
Take in config file -> return map of random offsets


3.
MATLAB Function that:
Take in map of node_id : offsets —> return new config file with optimized offsets 


4.
MATLAB Function that:
Take in config file, parameters, result types —> run BeATS —> return results in a file
